LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, 
least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, 
and singular value problems. The associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, 
QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are related computations 
such as reordering of the Schur factorizations and estimating condition numbers. 
Dense and banded matrices are handled, but not general sparse matrices. In all 
areas, similar functionality is provided for real and complex matrices, in both 
single and double precision.

The files have been moved from .f files to .inc
files (to adopt the WRFDA convention).

The lapack source has been changed by the convert.f90 program, turning
the code into free-format.  The only other modification is that the
imbedded tabs in the source have been turned into spaces (otherwise
convert.f90 coughs up a spleen).
