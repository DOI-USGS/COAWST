C SUBPROGRAM:    DRFINI
C   PRGMMR: WOOLLEN          ORG: NP20       DATE: 2002-05-14
C
C ABSTRACT:  THIS SUBROUTINE INITIALIZES DELAYED REPLICATION FACTORS
C   AND EXPLICITLY ALLOCATES A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT OF SPACE IN THE
C   INTERNAL SUBSET ARRAYS, THEREBY ALLOWING THE SUBSEQUENT USE OF BUFR
C   ARCHIVE LIBRARY SUBROUTINE UFBSEQ TO WRITE DATA DIRECTLY INTO
C   DELAYED REPLICATION SEQUENCES.  NOTE THAT THIS SAME TYPE OF
C   INITIALIZATION IS DONE IMPLICTLY WITHIN BUFR ARCHIVE LIBRARY
C   SUBROUTINE UFBINT FOR DELAYED REPLICATION SEQUENCES WHICH APPEAR
C   ONLY ONE TIME WITHIN AN OVERALL SUBSET DEFINITION.  HOWEVER, BY
C   USING SUBROUTINE DRFINI ALONG WITH A SUBSEQUENT CALL TO SUBROUTINE
C   UFBSEQ, IT IS ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO HAVE MULTIPLE OCCURRENCES OF A
C   PARTICULAR DELAYED REPLICATION SEQUENCE WITHIN A SINGLE OVERALL
C   SUBSET DEFINITION.

C USAGE:    CALL DRFINI (LUNIT, MDRF, NDRF, DRFTAG)
C   INPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     LUNIT    - INTEGER: FORTRAN LOGICAL UNIT NUMBER FOR BUFR FILE
C     MDRF     - INTEGER: ARRAY OF DELAYED REPLICATION FACTORS,
C                IN ONE-TO-ONE CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE NUMBER OF
C                OCCURRENCES OF DRFTAG WITHIN THE OVERALL SUBSET
C                DEFINITION, AND EXPLICITLY DEFINING HOW MUCH SPACE
C                (I.E. HOW MANY REPLICATIONS) TO ALLOCATE WITHIN
C                EACH SUCCESSIVE OCCURRENCE
C     NDRF     - INTEGER: NUMBER OF DELAYED REPLICATION FACTORS
C                WITHIN MDRF
C     DRFTAG   - CHARACTER*(*): SEQUENCE MNEMONIC, BRACKETED BY 
C                APPROPRIATE DELAYED REPLICATION NOTATION
C                (E.G. {}, () OR <>)
