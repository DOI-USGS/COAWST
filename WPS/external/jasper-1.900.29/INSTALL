Detailed instructions on how to build and install the JasPer software
can be found in the JasPer Software Reference Manual which is located
in the doc directory.  (See the section titled "Building the Software".)

If you are building the JasPer software directly from the contents of
the official JasPer GitHub repository (instead of from a proper release
archive file), you will need to do the following in order to install
JasPer:

    1) Ensure that the Autotools are installed on your system (i.e.,
    autoconf, automake, etc).

    2) Set your current directory to the top-level directory of the JasPer
    software tree (i.e., the directory containing the file named
    configure.ac), and run the command:

        autoreconf -i

    3) Jump to the step in the installation instructions in the JasPer
    Software Reference Manual just after the step that extracted the
    archive file contents, and proceed from there.
