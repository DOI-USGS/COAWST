# Remarks :                                                                 #
# - This test can be the basis of a fetch limited growth test for tuning    #
#   a wave model. Some considerations should be made then.                  #
#                                                                           #
#    (i)  Stable stationary conditions are reached fastest with the first   #
#         order propagation scheme. The results deviate little from a       #
#         higher order scheme as already pointed out in Tolman, (1992,      #
#         JPO). The first order scheme is therefore most suitable for such  #
#         tests.                                                            #
#                                                                           #
#    (ii) The third order scheme has some slightly discontinuous            #
#         characteristics, which can interact with the nonlinear            #
#         interactions. This leads to longer wiggling of the results in     #
#         near stationary conditions, and also appears to be the reason     #
#         for slight directional instabilities in this fetch-limited        #
#         test. If the third order scheme is to be used, the !/PR2_UQ option   #
#         with DTIME set as suggested in this script gives the most stable  #
#         results. Directional instabilities disappear of the initial       #
#         direction is shifted by half a directional step, using grid       #
#         setup                                                             #
#                                                                           #
#                            1.1  0.041  28  24  0.5                        #
#                                                                           #
#         It is not completely clear why the directional shift helps        #
#         stabilizing the directional properties of the spectra, but it is  #
#         assumed that this is related to the nonlinear interactions        #
#         between the third order scheme and Snl as mentioned above.        #
#                                                                           #
#   (iii) Note the effects of running with a one-dimensional case, where    #
#         long swell almost perpendicular to the coast arives at the coast, #
#         whereas this energy is generally not observed at the coast in a   #
#         model with limited width.                                         #
