\noindent
This wave model program requires and produces a plethora of input and output
files consistent with those of {\file ww3\_shel} in \para\ref{sec:ww3shel},
where file extensions {\file .ww3} are replaced by an identifier for a
specific grid. Note that all files are opened by name, and that the unit
number assignment is dynamic and automatic.

In order to make all existing features available there is a new version of the input file that uses namelists. This 
is the version that will be supported in the future as it allows a more flexible addition of new features. 
{\bf Please note that the namelist form is not supported by GCC compilers before version 4.8.2.}
