This kmabufr converter program is fully tested in PC Linux with pgi compiler
by Jim Bresch and Yong-Run Guo.

In this directory,

1, kma_bufr_src            ---- code to convert kma bufr obs to little_r obs

2, KMABUFR_to_LITTLE_R.csh ---- a shell script to compile and run 
                                the convertor program

3, kma_bufr_obs            ---- a set of the kma bufr obs data files 
                                as an example.

4, README file.

Before run KMABUFR_to_LITTLE_R.csh, you should

(1) Build the ecmwf library first;

    The ECMWF bufr library, while freeware, is licensed and 
    cannot be distributed with OBSPROC.

(2) Modify kma_bufr_src/Makefile to set the correct ecmwf library;

(3) Creat a "flist" file under the data directory 
    (here it is "kma_bufr_obs", see kma_bufr_obs/README.KMABUFR for details).

(4) Edit KMABUFR_to_LITTLE_R.csh to provide the correct directories.
