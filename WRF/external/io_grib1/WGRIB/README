Simple usage of the wgrib program (under the "howto:
grib -> ieee" section of the web page:

usage similar to diffwrf
wgrib -s GRIBFILE | wgrib -s -i GRIBFILE
This generates an ieee binary file called dump

wgrib -s GRIBFILE | wgrib -s -i -text GRIBFILE
This generates a text file called dump (text is
50-100x slower than ieee)

wgrib -s GRIBFILE | wgrib -s -i -text -o outfile GRIBFILE
This generates a text file called outfile
