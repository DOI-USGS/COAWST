# This ESMF configuration file includes the Run Sequence to couple      :::
# DATA, COAMPS, and ROMS components. All the components interact with   :::
# the same coupling time step. The connectors from ROMS to COAMPS and   :::
# COAMPS to ROMS are explicit. It is recommended to use the semi-       :::
# implicit RunSequence configuration to ensure conservation. Usually,   :::
# the timestep of the atmosphere kernel is smaller than that for the    :::
# ocean.                                                                :::
