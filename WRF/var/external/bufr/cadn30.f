C SUBPROGRAM:    CADN30
C   PRGMMR: ATOR             ORG: NP12       DATE: 2004-08-18
C
C ABSTRACT:  GIVEN THE BIT-WISE REPRESENTATION OF THE FXY VALUE
C   FOR A DESCRIPTOR, THIS ROUTINE CALLS FUNCTION ADN30 AND STORES
C   ITS RETURN VALUE (I.E. THE ASCII-EQUIVALENT FXY VALUE) AS THE
C   ROUTINE OUTPUT VALUE.  THIS MECHANISM (I.E. A FORTRAN SUBROUTINE
C   WRAPPER RETURNING ADN AS A CALL PARAMETER, RATHER THAN DIRECTLY
C   CALLING THE FORTRAN FUNCTION ADN30 FROM WITHIN A C ROUTINE)
C   ALLOWS SAFE AND PORTABLE (ALBEIT INDIRECT) ACCESS TO THE ADN30
C   FUNCTION LOGIC FROM WITHIN A C ROUTINE.
