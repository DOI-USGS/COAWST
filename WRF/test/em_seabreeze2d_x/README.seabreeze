The purpose of this case is to demonstrate how one can set up all land variables
in order to use a full-physics set-up in an idealized case. 

This test case is an attempt to produce a two dimensional sea breeze simulation.
Configuration needs tuning to produce desirable results, as the current
settings give a very shallow sea breeze. As of V3.6 the eta_levels are listed
in the namelist and used instead of the idealized eta levels. This gives
more levels in the sea breeeze layer.

The input sounding has no wind.

There is no Coriolis [grid%f(i,j)=0.]. 
There is a diurnal cycle and the latitude and longitude are set for radiation to work.
Note that since the longitude is set to zero, start_hour in the namelist
is the local time as well as the UTC time (5Z  in the namelist).
For other longitudes the start_hour refers to UTC time.
The land-surface fields are filled so that the slab, Noah or RUC LSMs can be used.

This setup is for a 2D case with 202 grid points in x and 35 eta levels. The land occupies 50 grid
points in the middle of the domain. The width of the land can be changed
by modifying variable lm (half width for land points) in 
dyn_em/module_initialize_ideal.F.

As of V3.6 an example of 8 tracers are initialized in this case and mixed with
the PBL option. These are set up in the initialize module.
