1.5.0a  wgrib failing with no GDS and constant field.  Cannot determine 
(9/96)  the size of data without a center-dependent lookup table.
        Set length size of data to 1.

1.5.0   -v option: major changes, now an inventory
(9/96)  -V option: added century to date code, list parameter table number,
           added description of variable
        Added parameter table (NCEP-128) for the ocean modeling branch of NCEP.
        Added user-defined parameter tables.
        Note: changes are incompatible with grib2ctl.  Get new version.
         (old version works by changing "wgrib -v" to "wgrib -V".)
        V1.5.0 is the first version to be parameter-table aware.  As a
         result, wgrib will give a warning if it cannot find a matching
         parameter table.  The warning can be eliminated by either using
         a user-defined parameter table or by adding your table into
         the wgrib source.  (Contact w. ebisuzaki, Wesley.Ebisuzaki@noaa.gov).
        Built-in tables: NCEP-2, NCEP-128, ECMWF-160.
        Much faster flt2ieee routine, changed rounding factor in flt2ieee
         so that IEEE machines gets the correct last bit.
        Increased NTRY to 100 to accommodate Automation div headers.
        The 1.4.x series didn't last long (1 revision, 3/96 to 7/96).

1.4.1a  Several optimizations of the grib routines for reduced CPU usage.
(6/96)  Updated the NCEP parameter table and altered the print statement
        for climatological fields.


1.4 ******************************************************************
1.4 
1.4 BUG: Prior to v1.4, when the start of the grib message was less
1.4  than 160 bytes from the end of the file, wgrib would not find
1.4  the message.  This would only occur if a short grib message (< 160 bytes)
1.4  ended the file.  Basically I had assumed that a grib message
1.4  had to be 160+ bytes in length.  Well someone at NCEP decided
1.4  to write 84-byte grib messages!  About the only field that
1.4  can be described in a 84-byte message is uniform value of zero.
1.4
1.4  Fixed a bug in the return code, and made the code 10% faster.
1.4
1.4  Since this is a bug fix PLEASE upgrade to version 1.4.
1.4  Why not? It's free!  (3/96)
1.4
1.4 ******************************************************************


1.3.4h  Complaint about wgrib failing if the file has no GDS.  Since a GDS
(2/96)  is recommended (and is in every file that I have seen) I've never 
        included the code to create a GDS for prespecified grids.  This 
        version is a temporary fix. It sets the array size to NX x 1.
        [7/96: This temporary fix will have to do.  The GDS prespecified 
        grids are center dependent.  Since I don't have the tables, nothing
        is planned.]

1.3.4f  updated ECMWF parameter table (from M. Fiorino)
(11/95)	support for the ECMWF stream parameter
	clean compiles using acc (SunOS) (acc is pickier than gcc -Wall)

1.3.4e  writing grib files made much faster
(11/95)
1.3.4d  minor change in error statement format
(9/95)
1.3.4c  didn't check for case where number of bits = 0! in NMC bug check
(7/95)
1.3.4   added check for bad bds "used bits" parameter (look for NMC bug)
(7/95)
1.3.3:  (preliminary) ECMWF parameter table added
(5/95)
1.3.2:  preliminary polar stereographics map support
(4/95)

To Do:
   decode spherical harmonics (need some examples to test on)
   complex packing?

Adding new parameter tables is pretty easy and I'm willing to add new
parameter tables for "operational centers". (Note, the GRIB center
identification numbers are assigned by the WMO.)
