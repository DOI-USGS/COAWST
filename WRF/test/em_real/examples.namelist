** for tc bogusing:
   Helpful hints
   1) The TC bogus *MUST* only be run with a single processor: serial 
      (with or without a nest build option), or as a DM build with np=1.
   2) Run the TC program for only the initial model time. Remember to copy 
      your metgrid file to a safe location and then let the TC scheme 
      generate the auxiliary files.
   3) The TC program does not handle soil moisture or soil temperature 
      correctly. After running the TC program, use an NCL script to put the 
      modified fields back into the original metgrid file (remember that you
      are keeping a pristine copy elsewhere). The modified fields to copy
      are:  "RH", "TT", "UU", "VV", "GHT", "PRES", "PMSL", "PSFC".
   4) The TC program runs quickly, only a few seconds. It is a good idea to 
      process multiple runs, and vary the TC initialization. It would be 
      reasonable to select the maximum wind speed (vmax_meters_per_second) 
      from 30 to 60 by 5, select the radius of maximum winds ((m), rmax) = 
      50000 to 200000 by 50000, and select a tuning parameter for the 
      vortex (vmax_ratio) = 0.5 to 0.9 by 0.1. Look at the resulting 
      bogus storms (sea level pressure, surface wind speeds, and 
      overall storm size), and choose the best.  
   5) Remember to also consider starting the TC program at a later or
      earlier time during your parameter space exploration.
   6) The bogus storm will organize better if the initialization of the
      tropical storm is entirely over water, and if the storm is able to 
      develop over water for several days.
   7) After the metgrid file is finalized, and the real program is run,
      use DFI in WRF. Removing and then introducing an entire bogus typhoon
      is the definition of unbalanced. Running DFI for 2-3 hours back and forth
      will be a benefit. For a successful implementation of a TC bogus storm in 
      WRF, the storm should not oscillate in size, should not be radiating 
      massive amounts of gravity waves, and should not rapidly weaken.

** Tropopause data level of max winds data, for program real.exe only

When information (mostly NCEP supplied through GFS or NAM) is available 
in the Grib2 file, AND extracted with ungrib, the metgrid program inserts
flag information into the data stream that is input by real.  The real
program is able to use the available u, v, T, height fields (each may be on
a tropopause .OR. the level of max winds) in the vertical interpolation.
To "tune" the data, the user may select a level below which the max wind 
inforamtion is ignored.  The default is 300 hPa.  The user may also 
select the level that when exceeded the trop and maxw fields are ignored
(due to the horizontal pressure difference detecting a user-defined
discontinuity, and the metgrid horizontal interpolation across the 
discontinuity would be suspect).  By default, this option is turned off.
The user may choose to individually activate the vertical interpolation of
either the level of max winds .OR. the tropopause level.

** The hybrid vertical coordinate (HVC) requires three pieces:
1. The WRF and real codes must be built with HVC activated (./configure -hyb)
2. The eta location (etac) at which the eta levels higher up in the atmosphere
   become isobaric must be defined (suggested default in Registry).
3. The run-time option to select the HVC (hybrid_opt, default is OFF): 
&dynamics
 hybrid_opt          = 2,
 etac                = 0.2,

** New mechanism to specify physics:

&physics
 physics_suite = 'CONUS'

which is equivalent to

 mp_physics         = 8,
 cu_physics         = 6,
 ra_lw_physics      = 4,
 ra_sw_physics      = 4,
 bl_pbl_physics     = 2,
 sf_sfclay_physics  = 2,
 sf_surface_physics = 2,

&physics
 physics_suite = 'TROPICAL'

which is equivalent to

 mp_physics         = 6,
 cu_physics         = 16,
 ra_lw_physics      = 4,
 ra_sw_physics      = 4,
 bl_pbl_physics     = 1,
 sf_sfclay_physics  = 91,
 sf_surface_physics = 2,


To overwrite the cu_physics option for a second nest, set 

 &physics
 physics_suite                       = 'tropical'
 cu_physics                          = -1,    -1,     0,
 ...

** New way to automatically choose levels (default auto_levels_opt=2)
 max_dz                              = 1000.

 dzbot                               = 50.
 dzstretch_s                         = 1.3
 dzstretch_u                         = 1.1
