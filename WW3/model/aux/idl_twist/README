This directory contains The Wave Ifremer-SHOM Tool for visualization. 
The GUI is launched by typing @visu in front of the idl prompt (using 
a licence or the demo version). Without a licence, please 
download the rt_visumain.sav compile version and use the (free) 
IDL runtime application. 

All information and how to use the GUI can be found here:
