# Remarks :                                                                 #

# - This grid is based on a nominally 0.24 degree global tripole grid       #
#   provided by Alan Walcraft (NRL). The "0.24 degree" here refers          #
#   to the resolution at the equator. Here, only higher latitudes  are      #
#   included (so in fact, it has only two poles, both at the top). This     #
#   resulting grid is described by files named *.1500x200                   #
#                                                                           #
#   For grid *.1500x200 :                                                   #
#                                                                           #
#   The min. grid spacing along i is approx. 5.5 km (1/20 deg lat)          #
#   The median grid spacing along i is approx. 10.4 km (1/11 deg lat)       #
#   The max. grid spacing along i is approx. 12.2 km (1/9 deg lat)          #
#                                                                           #
#   The min. grid spacing along j is approx. 10.5 km (1/11 deg lat)         #
#   The median grid spacing along j is approx. 11.3 km (1/10 deg lat)       #
#   The max. grid spacing along j is approx. 15.2 km (1/7 deg lat)          #
#                                                                           #
#   One should also be aware that this grid has poor characteristics over   #
#   some land areas (near the two northern poles). Therefore, it is not     #
#   recommended to use it without the bathymetry. Contrast with the Arctic  #
#   grid, for which we are able to run a case with no bathymetry (deep      #
#   water).                                                                 #
#                                                                           #
#   To make the computation time of the regtest more manageable, a mask is  #
#     used to activate only a small portion of the overall grid points      #
#     available in the  *.1500x200 files.                                   #
#     The active points are north of the Kara Sea,                          #
#     Severnaya Zemlya (Russia), and Franz Josef Land (Russia)              #
#                                                                           #
#   For active portion of grid, defined by the mask  :                      #
#                                                                           #
#     The min. grid spacing along i is approx. 10.5 km                      #
#     The median grid spacing along i is approx. 10.7 km                    #
#     The max. grid spacing along i is approx. 11.0 km                      #
#                                                                           #
#     The min. grid spacing along j is approx. 10.1 km                      #
#     The median grid spacing along j is approx. 10.4 km                    #
#     The max. grid spacing along j is approx. 10.7 km                      #
#                                                                           #
#   Note that the min grid spacing of sea points in *.1500x200 grid is      #
#     quite a bit smaller than the points activated by the mask. Therefore, #
#     with different mask (or no mask), one will need to change the CFL     #
#     time step.                                                            #

#   * only sea points north of 45N are not masked (this is called mask1)
#   * propagation only
# 
# input_1099x1500B
#   * as with 1099x1500, propagation only
#   * experimenting with HYCOM inputs (currents, winds, water levels, ice) 
#   * dates changed to match available HYCOM inputs
# 
# input_1099x1500C
#   * as with 1099x1500 and input_1099x1500B, still propagation only
#   * now using full grid (this is called mask2)
# 
# input_1099x1500D
#   * back to heavily-masked grid (mask1)
#   * now includes source terms.
# 
# input_1099x1500E
#   * full grid (mask2)
#   * includes source terms.
# 
# input_1099x1500F
