# - The rotated grid of North Atlantic and European region (NAE) is used    #
#   for the rotated grid test.  Boundary input files should be created with #
#   a consistent (same spectral resolution and source term) global model,   #
#   using the boundary point location listed in input/NAEWbndys.dat.  Note  #
#   that standard regular grid lat/lon coordinates should be used for both  #
#   the global and NAE model input files.  The standard lat/lon are         #
#   converted into equatorial (roated) lat/lon inside the model.  Similar   #
#   standard lat/lon coordiantes are used for the 2D spectral output list   #
#   in ww3_shel.inp.  The model will convert them inside the model.         #
#                                                                           #
#   Wind, ice and current forcing files should be converted into rotated    #
#   grid in the .ww3 format.  Conversion outside the WW3 model may be done  #
#   with IDL scripts or by FORTRAN program by adaption of the two rotation  #
#   subs in module w3servmd.ftn:                                            #
#     W3LLTOEQ       convert standard into rotated lat/lon, plus AnglD      #
#     W3EQTOLL       revers of the LLTOEQ, but AnglD unchanged.             #
#                                                                           #
