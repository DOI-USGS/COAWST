The purpose of this case is to demonstrate an idealized convective-radiative
equilibrium 3d run driven by the SST. Run for weeks to months, this develops
a steady-state convection in a weak wind background typical of the tropics
with a grid size small enough (1 km) to resolve individual updrafts.
The test case domain and run length are small compared to typical runs and
serve only as a demonstration.

The initialization makes use of the full physics initialization in the
sea-breeze case but, new in V3.7, the SST can be specified in input_sounding
via the surface temperature in the first line and the surface is all-ocean
by default. There is a small Coriolis force of 2.5e-5 and a random low-level
temperature perturbation to initiate the convection.

The input sounding has u=5 m/s, and SST=300 K with a moist profile to support
convection.
pert_coriolis is true so the input_sounding wind is taken to be geostrophically
balanced.
Use the run_me_first.csh script to copy necessary data files for radiation.

This setup is for a 3D case with 101x101 grid points, dx=1 km, and 35 eta levels. 
The top is at 30 km. The physics choices are WSM6 microphysics, RRTMG radiation,
the 5-layer slab model (inactive due to water surface), and YSU PBL scheme.
There are periodic boundaries and w-Rayleigh damping at the top.
Buckets are turned on for rainfall and radiation budgets because this is designed
to be a long run that may be a month or more to obtain equilibrium.
