# sample input file for runtime config of I/O streams

# This toy example adds the state variables u,v,w,and julian
# to the set of variables that are output with auxiliary
# history stream auxhist21. 
+:h:21:u,v,w,julian

# At the same time different the same and different variables
# may be removed from the standard output stream.
-:h:0:W,P,PB,PH,PHB,T,U,V

As many of the extra streams as wanted may be used.  The largest
is currently set to 24.  It is usually safe to use a large 
stream number and then start working your way down.
+:h:24:RAINC,RAINNC
