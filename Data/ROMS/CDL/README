ROMS/TOMS Metadata
==================

This directory contains several CDL files showing ROMS input NetCDF
files structure. There is a lot of software out there to generate
such input files. It is very difficult to write generic programs
because it depends on the application. However, there is a very easy
way to generate these files using the CDL and the NetCDF "ncgen"
program.

The ROMS metadata design is very rich and extensive. See "varinfo.yaml"
for a list of all the variables names, units, attributes, associated time
variables, and scale factors. This is an user friendly file and variable
parameters can be changed very easily. As a matter of fact, some users like
to change the long-name attribute to a language other than English to
facilitate automatic labeling during plotting. However, for portability
I recommend to use the provided field variable name.

Currently, you can find the following CDL scripts:

    grd_spherical.cdl        Spherical grid NetCDF file

    ini_hydro.cdl            Initial conditions NetCDF file (hydrodynamics)

    ini_sed.cdl              Initial conditions NetCDF file (hydrodynamics and sediment)

    clm_ts.cdl               Temperature-Salinity climatology NetCDF file

    frc_uvstress.cdl         Forcing NetCDF file (surface momentum stresses)

    adsend.cdf               Adjoint sensitivity functional

    s4dvar_obs.cdl           4D-Var observations

    s4dvar_std_m.cdl         4D-Var model error covariance standard deviation
    s4dvar_std_i.cdl         4D-Var initial conditions error covariance standard deviation
    s4dvar_std_b.cdl         4D-Var open boundaries error covariance standard deviation
    s4dvar_std_f.cdl         4D-Var surface forcing error covariance standard deviation


Currently, there are two vertical, terrain-following coordinates
transformation in ROMS.  You need to choose the appropriate
"standard_name" attribute:

(1) Original transformation: "ocean_s_coordinate_g1"

        double s_rho(s_rho) ;
                s_rho:long_name = "S-coordinate at RHO-points" ;
                s_rho:valid_min = -1. ;
                s_rho:valid_max = 0. ;
                s_rho:positive = "up" ;
                s_rho:standard_name = "ocean_s_coordinate_g1" ;
                s_rho:formula_terms = "s: s_rho C: Cs_r eta: zeta depth: h depth_c: hc" ;

        double s_w(s_w) ;
                s_w:long_name = "S-coordinate at W-points" ;
                s_w:valid_min = -1. ;
                s_w:valid_max = 0. ;
                s_w:positive = "up" ;
                s_w:standard_name = "ocean_s_coordinate_g1" ;
                s_w:formula_terms = "s: s_w C: Cs_w eta: zeta depth: h depth_c: hc" ;

(2) New transformation: "ocean_s_coordinate_g2"

        double s_rho(s_rho) ;
                s_rho:long_name = "S-coordinate at RHO-points" ;
                s_rho:valid_min = -1. ;
                s_rho:valid_max = 0. ;
                s_rho:positive = "up" ;
                s_rho:standard_name = "ocean_s_coordinate_g2" ;
                s_rho:formula_terms = "s: s_rho C: Cs_r eta: zeta depth: h depth_c: hc" ;

        double s_w(s_w) ;
                s_w:long_name = "S-coordinate at W-points" ;
                s_w:valid_min = -1. ;
                s_w:valid_max = 0. ;
                s_w:positive = "up" ;
                s_w:standard_name = "ocean_s_coordinate_g2" ;
                s_w:formula_terms = "s: s_w C: Cs_w eta: zeta depth: h depth_c: hc" ;

Notice that the nondimentional, fractional, stretched vertical coordinate
is the same excet to the value of the attribute "standard_name".

You can easily edit any of these files to change NetCDF file name, change
dimensions, add and remove variables, and add and modify global attibutes.
A NetCDF file can be created by typing:

    ncgen -b my_file.cdl

Then, you can use any program to write your data into the created NetCDF
file. I usually use the MeXCDF interface of Matlab to write the processed
data with just a single command line.

Notice that ROMS now allows for multiple forcing NetCDF files. See
input script.
