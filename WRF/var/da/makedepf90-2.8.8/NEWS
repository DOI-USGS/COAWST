* 2.8.8 (13.6 2006)
    - Close include files when we are done reading them.

* 2.8.7 (13.6 2006)
    - More informative error messages in case of I/O errors.

* 2.8.6 (31.3 2006)
    - Fixed problem with continuation lines in fixed form, introduced in
      version 2.8.5.

* 2.8.5 (29.3 2006)
    Fixed two bugs
     - Some cpp-lines continued by a \ at the end made makdepf90 hang.
     - In fixed form, makedepf90 was sometimes tricked into beliving it was
       inside a string, when it actually wasn't.

* 2.8.4 (18.2 2006)
    - Portability fix for NetBSD. (Emil Skoeldberg)

* 2.8.3 (23.1 2006)
    - Better error recovery: When confused, makedepf90 doesn't emit fatal
      IPE:s anymore, but tries to recover and, optionally (-Wconfused),
      print a warning message.
    - Fixed an error with giving wrong file name in error/warning messages
      in some cases.

* 2.8.2 (20.1 2006)
    - Fixed a problem with cpp and operator '&&' causing IPE:s (Internal
      Parser Error)
    - Fixed problem with a comment line between a (splitted) line and its
      continuation.

* 2.8.1 (20.1 2006)
    - Fixed problem with variables/TYPE members/etc. named 'use', 'include'
      or something else that made makedepf90 confused.

* 2.8.0 (19.12 2005)
    - Add new option -I to specify paths to search for source files, if not
      found in the current working directory.
    - Fixed bug with the -D option.
    - Accept tabs in a few more places. (These three by Jim Edwards)
    - Portability fix so that makedepf90 can be compiled in some older
      compilers. (Janne Blomqvist)

* 2.7.1 (5.9 2005)
    - Fix problem with comments ending in EOF without a '\n' first.

* 2.7.0 (9.5 2005)
    - Fix problem introduced by the 2.5 version; *.o files were by default
      placed in the current directory rather than the source file
      directory.  This has now been changed back to the <= 2.4 behavior.
      People who depend on the 2.5/2.6 behavior, can get it back by using
      the option -b "".

* 2.6.2 (22.02 2004)
    - Accept lines ending in '\r\n'.  (I was also planing to improve
      include file searching, but it seems that I never get the time to
      do it.  Not that it's anything large, but ...)

* 2.6.1 (27.10 2003)
    - A stupid mistake in the 'undef'-handling code fixed (undef:ing an
      undefined macro made makedepf90 crash).

* 2.6 (25.10 2003)
    - Fixed problem with preprocessor 'undef':s, as well as a few 'hidden'
      problems in the code.

* 2.5 (22.9 2003) 
    - Added option '-b' to let the user specify an alternate build
      directory. (Derek Dolney)

* (2.4 2003)
    - Updated NEWS.  Since nothing else has changed, I didn't bother to
      change the version number.

* 2.4 (11.12 2002)
    - Fixed access of freed memory (Willem Vermin)
    - Fixed reference to uninitialized memory (me) 

* 2.3 (26.07 2002)
    Makedepf90 is now more tolerant against "exotic" statement endings
    (like e.g. end-of-file without end-of-line first) 

* 2.2 (15.01 2002)
    Improved README 

* 2.2beta (06.12 2001)
    - Makedepf90 has been rewritten in C.  This is not an as big rewrite as
      it might sound like; the C++ code didn't make use of many C++
      specific features.
    - A new GNU autoconf based installation system (somewhat experimental
      at the moment)
    - A new option -nosrc removes the explicit dependency on the source
      file. 

* 2.1 (19.03 2001)
    -Added support for C-style comments in cpp-expressions
    -Added support for multi-line strings in fixed format

* 2.0 (final) (10.02 2001)
    Minor code cleanup.  Updated man-page and README file.  Since no
    bugs has been reported for a while, I think it's time for final release
    of the 2.0 version.

* 2.0beta.4 (25.01 2001)
    Fixed an inline-comment bug

* 2.0beta.3 (unreleased)
    A few portability problems fixed.

* 2.0beta.2 (16.01 2001)
    A few portability problems fixed. 

* 2.0beta.1 (02.01 2001)
    Support for #if:s is thrown away and the support for
    #ifdef and #ifndef has been strengthen instead, it
    works now for both cpp and f90ppr. I don't plan any new features before
    the final 2.0.  Try it out and report any bugs or other problems.

* 2.0devel.16 (29.12 2000)
    (Incomplete) support for cpp #if and #elif.  
    A few bug-fixes.

* 2.0devel.14 (27.12 2000)
    Added support for cpp #ifdef and #ifndef
    (#if is not yet supported) 

* 1.1.1 and 2.0devel.10
    Problems with variable argument list in some compilers fixed (at
    least I hope so).  

* 2.0devel.9 (04.10 2000)
    -Fixed a few memory-leaks
    -Fixed an error-reporting bug
    -Added #undef-support
        
* 2.0devel.7 (28.09 2000)
    Rudimentary #define-support (nothing really useful yet)
        
        
* 2.0devel.6 (14.09 2000)
    Has roughly the same features as 1.1, but is less well tested.

* 1.1 (6.09 2000)
    No bugs have been reported for a while, and I haven't found any my
    self either, so I thought it would be time to call it 'stable'.  (No
    new features or fixed bugs since 1.1beta.3) 

* 1.1beta.3 (28.08 2000)
    Fixed an inconsistency between program behavior and documentation
    regarding spaces between options and their arguments.  

* 1.1beta.2 (18.08 2000)
    Fixed a small bug with recognizing strings in certain cases.

* 1.1beta.1 (10.08 2000)
    Added support for coco.

    The new features since 1.0 are now so many that I thought that it is
    justified to increment the mid version number.  I decided to call it
    "beta", since some of the new features are still not thoroughly tested.
        

* 1.0.13 (06.08 2000)
    -Support for f90ppr should work a little bit better now.
    -Added options -o and -l to create a
     dependency-line + rule to link the compiled *.o-files to an
     executable file.

* 1.0.12 (03.08 2000)
    Added the option '-R file rule' to assign rules individually for
    different files.

* 1.0.11 (01.08 2000)
    Parser somewhat reorganized.  No new features.

* 1.0.10 (31.07 2000)
    -Added support for f90ppr (but didn't test it)
    -Fixed small bug with keywords in strings

* 1.0.7 (25.07 2000)
    -Added option -d dependency to make all targets
     dependent on dependency.
    -Added option -r rule to add rule
     (indented by a tab) to all dependency lines.
    -Cleaned up the code a little bit

* 1.0.4 (18.07 2000)
    Fixed problems with ';':s, and cleaned up the code a little bit

* 1.0.3 (18.07 2000)
    Fixed problems with ONLY

    Removed unnecessary warning messages.

    Lots of small fixes

    Improved support for statements splitted on several lines.

* 0.9.2 (29.06 2000)
    Improved support for fixed format source code.

* 0.9.1 (27.06 2000)
    Added option -u modulename to ignore module 'modulename'.

* 0.8.6 (26.06 2000)

    ...)
