BUFR library is a Fortran/C subroutine library of encoding or decoding BUFR messages,
developed at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction.

==========

The WRFDA usage of the bufr package is for reading/writing bufr
data for usage in the prepbufr and satellite radiance data assimilation.  The files have been 
moved from .f files to .inc files (to adopt the WRFDA convention).
Additionally, the bufrlib.h has been modified to accomodate the convention of C <-> F on  
different platforms. a da_bufr.f90 is used as a wrapper to include all *.inc

The bufr source has been changed by the convert.f90 program, turning
the code into free-format.  The only other modification is that the
imbedded tabs in the source have been turned into spaces (otherwise
convert.f90 coughs up a spleen).
