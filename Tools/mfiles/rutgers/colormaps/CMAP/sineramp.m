% SINERAMP  - Generates sine on a ramp colour map test image
%
% The test image consists of a sine wave superimposed on a ramp function The
% amplitude of the sine wave is modulated from its full value at the top of the
% image to 0 at the bottom. 
%
% The image is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of different colour maps.
% Ideally the sine wave pattern should be equally discernible over the full
% range of the colour map.  In addition, across the bottom of the image, one
% should not see any identifiable features as the underlying signal is a smooth
% ramp.  In practice many colour maps have uneven perceptual contrast over their
% range and often include 'flat spots' of no perceptual contrast that can hide
% significant features.
%
% Usage: im = sineramp(sze, amp, wavelen, p)
%        im = sineramp;
%
% Arguments:     sze - [rows cols] specifying size of test image.  If a
%                      single value is supplied the image is square. 
%                      Defaults to [256 512];  Note the number of columns is
%                      nominal and will be ajusted so that there are an
%                      integer number of sine wave cycles across the image.
%                amp - Amplitude of sine wave. Defaults to 12.5
%            wavelen - Wavelength of sine wave in pixels. Defaults to 8.
%                  p - Power to which the linear attenuation of amplitude, 
%                      from top to bottom, is raised.  For no attenuation use
%                      p = 0.  For linear attenuation use a value of 1.  For
%                      contrast sensitivity experiments use larger values of
%                      p.  The default value is 2. 
% 
% The ramp function that the sine wave is superimposed on is adjusted slightly
% for each row so that each row of the image spans the full data range of 0 to
% 255.  Thus using a large sine wave amplitude will result in the ramp at the
% top of the test image being reduced relative to the slope of the ramp at the
% bottom of the image. However, the adjustment ensures that, at the lower edge
% of the image, the full colour map is displayed.
%
% To start with try
%  >> im = sineramp;  
%
% This is equivalent to 
%  >> im = sineramp([256 512], 12.5, 8, 2);
%
% View it under 'gray' then try the 'jet', 'hsv', 'hot' etc colour maps.  The
% results may cause you some concern!
%
% If you are wishing to evaluate a cyclic colour map, say hsv, it is suggested
% that you use the test image generated CIRCLESINERAMP.  However you can use
% this function to perform a basic evaluation of a cyclic colour map by
% displaying two copies of the SINERAMP test image concatenated side-by-side.
%
%  >> show([sineramp sineramp]), colormap(map_to_be_tested)
%
% However, note that despite there being an integer number of sine wave cycles
% across the image and that each row has been adjusted to span the full data
% range there will be a slight cyclic discontinuity at the top of the image,
% though this is progressively removed as you move down the test image.  
%
% See source code comments for more details on the default wavelength and
% amplitude.

% The Default Wavelength:
% The default wavelength is 8 pixels.  On a computer monitor with a nominal
% pixel pitch of 0.25mm this corresponds to a wavelength of 2mm.  With a monitor
% viewing distance of 600mm this corresponds to 0.19 degrees of viewing angle or
% approximately 5.2 cycles per degree.  This falls within the range of spatial
% frequencies (3-7 cycles per degree ) at which most people have maximal
% contrast sensitivity to a sine wave grating (this varies with mean luminance).
% A wavelength of 8 pixels is also sufficient to provide a reasonable discrete
% representation of a sine wave.  The aim is to present a stimulus that is well
% matched to the performance of the human visual system so that what we are
% primarily evaluating is the colour map's perceptual contrast and not the
% visual performance of the viewer.
%
% The Default Amplitude:
% This is set at 12.5 so that from peak to trough we have a local feature of
% magnitude 25.  This is approximately 10% of the 256 levels in a standard
% colour map. It is not uncommon for colour maps to have perceptual flat spots
% that can hide features of this magnitude.
