Assimilation of MADIS data is not directly available through WRFDA. However, the WRFDA group 
maintains a conversion utility "MADIS2LITTLER", which converts netCDF MADIS data into LITTLE_R 
format for assimilation in WRFDA (or obs-nudging in WRF). You can find this utility on the web at 
the WRFDA website:

Compilation and use instructions can be found in the README file provided in that package.
