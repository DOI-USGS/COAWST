     There are two ways to get this data. 
      1. A subset of coefficient files can be download from 
         http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfda/download/crtm_coeffs.html
      2. The full set of CRTM coefficients may be downloaded from:
         ftp://ftp.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/jcsda/CRTM/REL-2.2.3/crtm_v2.2.3.tar.gz

  WRFDA with hybrid vertical coordinate (HVC) and moist potential temperature (THM):
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - 3DVAR works with HVC since V3.9, but does not work with THM
    - Neither WRFPlus nor 4DVAR work with HVC or THM
    - It is recommended to turn off HVC (set hybrid_opt=0, etac=0.0) and THM (set use_theta_m=0) 
      when using WRF V4.0 along with WRFDA V4.0

How to compile and run?
-----------------------

- In WRFDA directory, type `configure wrfda` - this will create a configure.wrf
  file that has appropriate compile options for the supported computers.

  Note: WRFDA only requires netCDF library for compilation
        Install netCDF library with the same compiler that will be used to compile WRFDA.
        NCEP BUFR and CRTM libs are included in the WRFDA tar file. 
        Set environment variables properly according to your applications
        before you type 'configure wrfda'. For example, 

        setenv NETCDF /usr/local/netcdf
        setenv RTTOV /usr/local/rttov11 (optional, set to compile WRFDA with RTTOV capability)

- Type 'compile all_wrfvar' when you are ready:

- If sucessful, this will create da_wrfvar.exe and a set of utilities
  in directory WRFDA/var/build/. 

- cd to the appropriate test or run directory to run WRFDA.

     Some basic instruction/namelist.input are available in sub-directories
     of WRFDA/var/test.

- See the Users Guide (http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfda/usersguide.html) for more detailed instructions.
