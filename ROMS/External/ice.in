! Input parameters can be entered in ANY order, provided that the parameter   !
! KEYWORD (usually, upper case) is typed correctly followed by "="  or "=="   !
! symbols. Any comment lines are allowed and must begin with an exclamation   !
! mark (!) in column one.  Comments may  appear to the right of a parameter   !
! specification to improve documentation.  All comments will ignored during   !
! reading.  Blank lines are also allowed and ignored. Continuation lines in   !
! a parameter specification are allowed and must be preceded by a backslash   !
! (\).  In some instances, more than one value is required for a parameter.   !
! If fewer values are provided, the  last value  is assigned for the entire   !
! parameter array.  The multiplication symbol (*),  without blank spaces in   !
! between, is allowed for a parameter specification.  For example, in a two   !
! grids nested application:                                                   !
!                                                                             !

!                                                                             !
! indicates that the first two entries of array AKT_BAK,  in fortran column-  !
! major order, will have the same value of "1.0d-6" for grid 1,  whereas the  !
! next two entries will have the same value of "5.0d-6" for grid 2.           !
!                                                                             !
! In multiple levels of nesting and/or multiple connected domains  step-ups,  !
! "Ngrids" entries are expected for some of these parameters.  In such case,  !
! the order of the entries for a parameter is extremely important.  It  must  !
! follow the same order (1:Ngrids) as in the state variable declaration. The  !
! USER may follow the above guidelines for specifying his/her values.  These  !
! parameters are marked by "==" plural symbol after the KEYWORD.              !
!                                                                             !
