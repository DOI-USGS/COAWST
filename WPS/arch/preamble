# configure.wps
#
# This file was automatically generated by the configure script in the
# top level directory. You may make changes to the settings in this
# file but be aware they will be overwritten each time you run configure.
# Ordinarily, it is necessary to run configure once, when the code is
# first installed.
#
# To permanently change options, change the settings for your platform
# in the file arch/configure.defaults, the preamble, and the postamble -
# then rerun configure.

# Look for compiled WRF code in one of several directories: WRF-4.0.2, WRF-4.0.1, WRF-4.0, WRF, and WRFV3.
# The need for complicated logic to do this arises from the various names that the WRF code may take
# on, depending on whether it was obtained through a GitHub archive file, as a clone of the GitHub
# repository, or an older WRF v3.x tar file.
# To override the path to the compiled WRF code, just set the WRF_DIR variable after the "endif" below
