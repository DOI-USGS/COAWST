# The coupling between DATA and ROMS components is used to test the     :::
# ROMS ESMF coupling framework. The atmospheric forcing fields are      :::
# exported to ROMS from the DATA component instead of processing the    :::
# directly the input NetCDF files specified in "roms.in".  The User     :::
# needs to activate TIME_INTERP in "build_roms" to export the field     :::
# time snapshots for ROMS to carry its time interpolation.              :::
