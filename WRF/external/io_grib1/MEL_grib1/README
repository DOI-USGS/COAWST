The code in this directory builds a library which is used to read and write 
grib data.  The code is a modified subset of the Navy's Master Environmental 
Laboratory's grib library.  The MEL grib library was ported to linux, then
taken apart to fit into the standard directory structure and Makefile structure
that we use as part of WxPredictor.
