The first implemented method ({\code IC1}) is for the user to specify
${k_i(x,t)}$, which is uniform in frequency space, ${C_{ice,1}}={k_i}$. The
parameters ${C_{ice,2}}$,...,${C_{ice,5}}$ are not used. An example setting
is ${C_{ice,1}}=2\times 10^{-5}$. Descriptions specific to {\code IC2} and {\code IC3} are
given in following sections. 

A full description of {\code IC1} can be found in \cite{rep:RO13} and a concise summary is given in \cite{rep:RPLA18}. This simple method was applied in \cite{art:LKS15} and is used as the modeling component of a model-data inversion procedure by \cite{art:RTS16}, \cite{rep:RPLA18}, and \cite{rep:RMK18}.
