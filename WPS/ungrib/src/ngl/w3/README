W3lib Library.
                                                                                
This library contains Fortran 90 decoder/encoder
routines for GRIB edition 1, general date manipulation
routines, and a Fortran 90 interface to "C"
language I/O routines.  The user API for the GRIB1 routines
is described in file "grib1.doc".
                                                                                
Some Fortran routines call "C" functions, which must
follow a specific symbol naming convention used by your
machine/loader to be linked successfully.
If you are having trouble linking to the routines
in this library, please make sure the appropriate
machine is defined as an option in the CFLAGS
variable in the Makefile.  See the first few lines
of the Makefile for valid options.
Recompile the library.
