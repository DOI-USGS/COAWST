BACIO Library.

This library contains Fortran 90 interface to "C"
language I/O routines.

The Fortran routines call "C" functions, which must
follow a specific symbol naming convention used by your
machine/loader to be linked successfully.
If you are having trouble linking to the routines
in this library, please make sure the appropriate 
machine is defined in the "clib.h" file and
recompile the library.
