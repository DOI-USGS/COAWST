!  2. PURPOSE
!
!     compute the frequency dependent counters in directional space
!     in a situation with a current and without a current.
!     The counters are only computed for the gridpoint
!     considered. This means IC = 1 (see loop with CALL for ICCODE
!     function)
!
!  3. METHOD
!
!     In absence of a current the fully 360 degrees sector is
!     subdivided in 4 sectors of 90 degrees each.
!
!     In presence of a current this is not the case anymore. The
!     counters of the directional space are frequency dependent.
!     It is first determined which bins have to taken into account
!     for a particular sweep (unconditionally stable for a specific
!     sector). To which sector a bin belongs is determined by its
!     propagation velocity Cx and Cy.
!
!     For the first sweep, all the bins with a positive propagation
!     velocity Cx and Cy have to taken into account.
!     For one particular frequency IS:

!                          -     -   -
!
!
!     As can be seen from the figure, the minimum and maximum
!     counter of the directional space are determined by the
!     vectorial sum of its groupvelocity and its current
!     velocity, c_g + U. Especially the higher frequencies are
!     modified by the current. The lower frequencies (due to
!     the larger propagation velocity) are less modified by a
!     current.
!
!     In general, we can distinguish 4 cases:
!
!     SWEEP 1:
!                                              ..*..
!                                           *.........*
!                                         |. ............      |   *..*
!            |              |            *|    ..o.......*     | *......*
!            |             *|*            |...... .......      | *......*
!            |           *  |..*          |*...     ....*      |   *..*

!       * *  |             *|*            |                    |
!     *     *|              |             |                    |
!       * *
!
!     SECTOR = 0        SECTOR = 2        SECTOR = 4       SECTOR = 1
!
!
!     The integer array SECTOR denotes which case is present for
!     a certain frequency:
!
!     0  : no bins belongs to first sweep, no sector lies within the
!          first sweep
!     2  : circle has 2 intersections with sector boundary
!     4  : circle has 4 intersections with sector boundary
!     1  : full circle lies within the first quadrant, all directions
!          have to taken into account
!
!     Furthermore it is detemined whether a certain BIN lies within
!     a specific quadrant. This is denoted by a logical array ANYBIN
!     In case of SECTOR = 4, this array is used to clear the rows
!     in the matrix IMATDA, IMATRA, IMATLA, IMATUA, which do not
!     belong to the first (or other) sweep (see subroutine SOLPRE).

!
!        40.13, Oct. 01: loop over IC now inside this subroutine

!        40.41, Oct. 04: common blocks replaced by modules, include files removed
!
!     2. PURPOSE
!
!        computes the propagation velocities of energy in X-, Y-
!        -space, i.e., CAX, CAY, in the presence or absence of
!        currents, for the action balance equation.
!
!        The propagation velocities are computed for the fully 360
!        degrees sector.
!
!     3. METHOD
!
!        The next equation are calculated:
!
!              @X     _
!        CAX = -- = n C cos (id) + Ux  = CGO cos(id) + Ux
!              @T
!
!              @Y     _
!        CAY = -- = n C sin(id)  + Uy  = CGO sin(id) + Uy
!              @T
!                                                         _
!     4. PARAMETERLIST
!

!                 IC = 2  Left or Right gridpoint
!                 IC = 3  Central gridpoint
!                Whether which value IC has, depends of the sweep
!                If necessary ic can be enlarged by increasing
!                the array size of ICMAX

!  8. Remarks
!
!  Motivation for using @C/@x instead of @h/@x :                                                                                     40.59
!  Formulae for computing CAD via @h/@x and @C/@x are identical. However, they differ in result due to numerics.                     40.59
!     Experiments suggest that @C/@x method with coarse resolution yields results that are similar to those                          40.59
!     using @C/@x or @h/@x with high resolution.                                                                                     40.59
!     By contrast, @h/@x method with coarse resolution yields considerably different result.                                         40.59
!  Further, using @C/@x allows for adding refraction by additional variables included in dispersion relation.                        40.59
!     Specifically, non-rigid seafloor (mud) can cause refraction even when water layer thickness (i.e. depths) are uniform.         40.59
!     Obviously, this type of refraction does require the mud to be non-uniform.                                                     40.59

!  Motivation for using centered scheme instead of upwind scheme :                                                                   40.59
!  Similar to above, the difference is only in numerics; experimental results suggest                                                40.59
!     better representation of unknown true solution via centered scheme.                                                            40.59
!  Further, upwind scheme can lead to non-physical asymmetry in CAD, and therefore wave action field                                 40.59
!  Further still, implementation of the upwind scheme in versions such as 40.41 and 40.51 used sweeping to                           40.59
!     keep track of results from neighboring sweeps. This involved large amounts of additional code, which is obviously undesirable. 40.59
!     The utility of this sweeping is not known to this author, since it does not seem to be strictly required by the upwind scheme. 40.59
!     As evidence, note that v30.75 used the upwind scheme, but did not have additional code for sweeping in SPROSD.                 40.59

!  Note that since we are using a centered scheme now, we stop before we get to the last grid point.                                 40.59
!  It would be possible to have separate code for falling back to the upwind scheme,                                                 40.59
!  but this may require sweeping, which would mean much additional code, see e.g. code of public release v40.51                      40.59

!  Note: RDX and RDY are unavailable for P5-P2 and P4-P3, so we use as approximation, 0.5*RDX(1), etc.                               40.59
!  Experience with implementation of more precise calculations of RDX,RDY, specifically with the SORDUP scheme,                      40.59
!      yielded imperceptible change in results. However, this could be added later if sufficiently motivated.                        40.59

!  The depth refraction limitation procedure (i.e. IREFR=-1) has been removed, because it is basically a "dirty fix" which           40.59
!      we hope/expect has been made unnecessary by the other changes here. If we are wrong about this, the "dirty fix" can be        40.59
!      restored, but this is not straightforward, since C is computed from k, which is an input argument not affected by IREFR.      40.59
!      To make this work, the depths would be limited here in SPROSD and k would then need to be calculated                          40.59
!      using the limited depths within SPROSD.                                                                                       40.59

!     1. UPDATE
!
!        33.10, Jan. 2000: subroutine SORDUP created. It is a modified STRSXY.
!        40.08, Mar. 2003: Improve scheme to use dx,dy calculated over two grid
!                          spaces (instead of one) where appropriate. This involves
!                          the use of RDX(3),RDX(4),RDY(3),RDY(4). This may or may not
!                          be a noticeable improvement. (I have not seen an example of a
!                          case where the original SORDUP does poorly relative to BSBT,
!                          so this is a speculative improvement).
!                          Remove option for controllable 1st order diffusion ("XYMU",
!                          "THETAK", etc.)
!        40.41, Oct. 04: common blocks replaced by modules, include files removed
!        40.59, Aug. 07: stencil modification
!        40.85, Aug. 08: store xy-propagation for output purposes
!        40.98, Feb. 09: SORDUP scheme is made consistent
!
!     2. PURPOSE
!
!        Purpose is to compute the space derivative of action transport using
!        the SORDUP scheme.
!        This is for stationary runs only (no time derivative).
!        The scheme is 2nd order accurate.                                40.08
!        The scheme reduces to the "best" approximation of                40.08
!             d/dx which can be determined using Taylor Series for the    40.08
!             stencil (ix),(ix-1),(ix-2):                                 40.08
!                         3/2*mu*phi(ix)-2*mu*phi(ix-1)+1/2*mu*phi(ix-2)  40.08

!         Notes (Rogers, Jan 10 2013) : I noticed a few years ago that there is
!            some asymmetry to this anti-GSE implementation that can be removed.
!            In some tests, the asymmetry results in something that looks like a lima bean
!            where we would expect an ellipsoid.
!            If we do this, it may make some swell dispersion look a bit more "natural"
!            Good news: the change is to the variable "D12AC", which means that it is not complicated by RDX RDY
!            Bad news: the change requires 3 new points in our stencil.
!
!         Notes (Rogers, Feb 21 2013) : this is now done.
!            from ./RDX_FD_NOSUBS/swan_clone.f90 :

!         <              D12AC = 0.25*(QDENS(IX+1,JY+1) -     QDENS(IX-1,JY+1) - QDENS(IX+1,JY-1) + QDENS(IX-1,JY-1)) ! corrected

!        The finite difference scheme for @^2/@x^2 is created by taking this relation:
!          @A/@x=(A(i+0.5)-A(i-0.5))/dx
!        ...and applying it twice, @(@A/@x)/@x=(A(i+1)-2*A(i)+A(i-1))/(dx^2)
!
!        The OLD finite difference scheme for @(@A/@x)/@y is mentioned in our paper, Rogers et al. (2002)
!          However, I don't know the origins of this scheme.
!
!        The NEW finite difference scheme for @(@A/@x)/@y is created by using these relations:
!          @A/@x=(A(i+1)-A(i-1))/(2*dx) @A/@y=(A(j+1)-A(j-1))/(2*dy)
!        ...and applying it together, giving @(@A/@x)/@y =
!           [A(i+1,j+1)-A(i-1,j+1)-A(i+1,j-1)+A(i-1,j-1)]/[4*dx*dy]

!  1. Updates
!
!     30.72, Feb. 98: Introduced generic names XCGRID, YCGRID and SPCSIG for SWAN
!     40.41, Oct. 04: common blocks replaced by modules, include files removed
!     40.85, Aug. 08: store sigma-propagation for output purposes

!  2. Purpose
!
!     comp. of @[CAS AC2]/@S initial & boundary : IMPLICIT SCHEME
!
!  3. Method
!
!     Compute the derivative in S-direction only n the central
!     gridpoint considered:
!                             Central grid point     : IC = 1
!
!     Depending on the parameter PNUMS(7) either a central difference
!     scheme (PNUMS(7) = 0) or an upstream scheme (PNUMS(7) = 1) is
!     used. Points 1, 2 and 3 are three consecutive points on the
!     T-axis. 2 is the central point for which @(C*A)/@SIGMA and
!     @(C*W*A)/@SIGMA is computed.

!  1. Updates
!
!     30.72, Feb. 98: Introduced generic names XCGRID, YCGRID and SPCSIG for SWAN
!     40.41, Oct. 04: common blocks replaced by modules, include files removed
!     41.07, Jul. 09: also central scheme blended with upwind scheme
!
!  2. Purpose
!
!     comp. of @[CAS AC2]/@S initial & boundary with an explicit
!     scheme. The energy near the blocking point is removed
!     from the spectrum based on a CFL criterion
!
!     The frequencies beyond ISSTOP are blocked in a 1-D situation
!     For a 2-D case the situation is somewhat more complicated (
!     see below)

!
!     2. PURPOSE
!
!        to estimate the action density depending of the sweep
!        direction during the first iteration of a stationary
!        computation. The reason for this is that AC2 is zero
!        at first iteration and no initialisation is given in
!        case of stationarity (NSTATC=0). Action density should
!        be nonzero because of the computation of the source
!        terms. The estimate is based on solving the equation
!
!            dN       dN
!        CAX -- + CAY -- = 0
!            dx       dy
!
!        in an explicit manner. In the estimate, the transmission
!        through obstacles or reflection at obstacles is taken into
!        account
!
!     3. METHOD

!          [RDX1*CAX + RDY1*CAY]*N(i-1,j) + [RDX2*CAX + RDY2*CAY]*N(i,j-1)

!  2. Purpose
!
!     computes the wave parameters K and CGO in the nearby
!     points, depending of the sweep direction.
!     The nearby points are indicated with the index IC (see
!     FUNCTION ICODE(_,_)
!
!  3. Method
!
!     The wave number K(IS,iC) is computed with the dispersion relation:
!
!     S = GRAV K(IS,IC)tanh(K(IS,IC)DEP(IX,IY))
!
!     where S = is logarithmic distributed via LOGSIG
!
!     The group velocity CGO in the case without current is equal to
!
!                    1       K(IS,IC)DEP(IX,IY)          S
!     CGO(IS,IC) = ( - + --------------------------) -----------

! 11. Remarks
!
!     DISSXY and LEAKXY are dissipation and leak integrated over the
!     spectrum for each point in the computational grid
!     The same holds for DSXBOT, DSXSRF and DSXWCP for bottom friction-,
!     surf- and whitecapping dissipation, respectively
!     DISSC0 and DISSC1 give the dissipation distributed over the
!     spectral space in one point of the computational grid
!     The same holds for DISBOT, DISSRF and DISWCP for bottom friction-,
!     surf- and whitecapping dissipation, respectively
!
!     Note on different source terms and transport terms for output purposing:
!     these terms in absolute value are integrated over the spectral space for
!     each grid point. In this way we can estimate the associated time scale.
!     Besides these terms we may also compute energy transfer between waves
!     and currents due to radiation stress.
!
