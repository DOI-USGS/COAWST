! Input parameters can be entered in ANY order, provided that the parameter   !
! KEYWORD (usually, upper case) is typed correctly followed by "="  or "=="   !
! symbols. Any comment lines are allowed and must begin with an exclamation   !

! specification to improve documentation.  Comments will be ignored  during   !
! reading.  Blank lines are also allowed and ignored. Continuation lines in   !
! a parameter specification are allowed and must be preceded by a backslash   !
! (\).  In some instances, more than one value is required for a parameter.   !
! If fewer values are provided, the  last value  is assigned for the entire   !

! DATA Model Set-up
!
! For each ESM component, specify the following information:
!
!   nDataExport(...)          The number of fields to export from DATA Model
!                             to specified ESM component. If zero value,
!                             exporting of fields to ESM component do not
!                             take place and the values in "DataExport" and
!                             "DataFiles" are ignored.
!
!    nDataFiles(...)          The number of NetCDF files that the DATA Model
!                             needs to process and read exporting fields.
!
!    DataExport(...)          Field short name string (see above table) to
!                             read and export to the specified ESM component,
!                             "nDataExport" values are expected for activated
!                             ESM component.
!
!     DataFiles(...)          NetCDF filenames containing the field to export
!                             to specified ESM component, nDataFiles are
!                             expected. The order of files in the list is
!                             essential. See information about multi-files
!                             below.
!
! Currently, the DATA model only EXPORTS fields. It is improbable that the
! DATA needs to import fields to itself.
!
! If applicable, the USER has the option to enter several sets of filenames
! for each nested grid.  Alternatively, if all the export fields are the same
! for each nesting grid, and the data is in its native resolution, we could
! enter only one set of filenames, and the DATA model will replicate those
! files internally to the remaining grids using the plural KEYWORD protocol.
! The USER may have different filenames for each export field.
!
! The DATA model will scan the files and will read the needed data from the
! first file in the list containing the export field. Therefore, the order of
! the filenames is critical. If using multiple files per nested grid, first
! enter all the filenames for grid one followed by two, and so on. It is also
! possible to split input data time records into several files (see Prolog
! instructions above). Use a single line per entry with a continuation (\)
! or a vertical bar (|) symbol after each entry, except the last one.

! IsActive         Logical switch (T/F) indicating if an Earth System Model
!                    (ESM) component is active or not. It is also used to
!                    process some coupling parameters specified in this
!                    input script.
!
!                    IsActive(roms)    Activate coupling to ROMS. If nesting,
!                                      enter NgridsR values. The first value
!                                      must be TRUE always. The user has the
!                                      choice to activate or not a particular
!                                      nested grid. By the default, NgridsR=1.
!
!                    IsActive(atmos)   Activate coupling to atmosphere model.
!                                      If nesting, enter NgridsA values. The
!                                      first value must be TRUE always. The
!                                      user has the choice to activate or not
!                                      a particular nested grid. By default,
!                                      NgridsA=1.
!
!                    IsActive(seaice)  Activate coupling to sea-ice model.
!                                      If nesting, enter NgridsI values. The
!                                      first value must be TRUE always. The
!                                      user has the choice to activate or not
!                                      a particular nested grid. By default,
!                                      NgridsI=1.
!
!                    IsActive(waves)   Activate coupling to wave model. If
!                                      If nesting, enter NgridsW values. The
!                                      first value must be TRUE always. The
!                                      user has the choice to activate or not
!                                      a particular nested grid. By default,
!                                      NgridsW=1.
!
!                    IsActive(data)    Activate coupling to a DATA model. It is
!                                      used to provide data to ESM components
!                                      uncoupled fields or to provide values at
!                                      locations not imported because of
!                                      noncoincident grids.
!
!                                      For example:
!
!                                        If just coupling ROMS-CICE, the DATA
!                                        model provides all the atmosphere
!                                        forcing fields required by CICE.
!
!                                        If atmosphere and ocean models grids
!                                        are not coincident, the DATA model
!                                        provides SST on locations not covered
!                                        by the usually smaller ocean grid.
!
!                  ESMF/NUOPC does not provide an elegant and straight way to
!                  coupled nested grids. The current design is to treat each
!                  nested grid as a unique coupled ESM component (see
!                  esmf_esm.F, esmf_roms.F, etc).
!
!                  If nesting, provide as many values to IsActive(xxxx) as
!                  needed for each nested grid. The order of the values is
!                  important. If only one value is set, only the application
!                  main grid is coupled.
!
! Coupled          Logical switch indicating which ESM components are connected
!                    during coupling (T/F). If the ESM component has nested
!                    grids, it specifies which ones are connected to other
!                    components.

! CouplingType     Model coupling type (check Glossary):

!                    CouplingType = 2    Semi-Implicit coupling
!
!                    In explicit coupling, the exchange fields at the next
!                    time-step (n+1) are defined using known values from the
!                    time-step (n) before it. Explicit methods require less
!                    computational effort and are accurate for small coupling
!                    time-steps.
!
!                    In implicit coupling, the exchange fields at the next
!                    time-step (n+1) are defined by including values at the
!                    next time-step (n+1). Implicit methods are stable and
!                    allow longer coupling time-steps but are expensier.
!
!                    In semi-implicit coupling, the exchange in one direction
!                    is explicit and in the reverse direction is implicit. For

! Melding weighting coefficients.
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! Melding coefficients used to combine fields from DATA and ESM components.
! The weight factors are read from the input NetCDF specified in the
! "WeightsFile(atmos)"  keyword.  The user has full control of how the
! merging is done. It is recommended to provide a gradual transition between
! the two components.  The weighting factors have the same dimension as
! the atmosphere grid.
!
! Recall that the DATA component supplies needed data to a particular ESM
! component.  For example, it may export data to the atmosphere model at
! locations not covered by the other ESM components because of smaller grid
! coverage.  If the atmosphere and ocean model grids are incongruent, the
! atmosphere component needs to import sea surface temperature (SST) on
! those grid points not covered by the ocean component. Thus, the weighting
! coefficients are used to merge the SST data:
!
!   SST_atm(:,:) = Cesm(:,:) * SST_esm(;,;) + Cdat(:,:) * SST_dat(:,:)
!
! where Cesm(:,:) + Cdat(:,:) = 1.
!
! Currently, only the atmosphere component needs the weigth coefficients
! when DATA_COUPLING is activated.
!
! WeightsFile(atmos) Input NetCDF containing weighting coefficients for the
!                    atmosphere grid.
!
! VnameDATA(atmos)   NetCDF variable name containing the weight factor (Cdat)
!                    for the DATA component.
!
! VnameESM(atmos)    NetCDF variable name containing the weight factor (Cesm)
!                    for the ESM component (usually ocean: ROMS).
!
! NestedGrid(atmos)  Atmosphere grid number needing a merged field from
!                    DATA and ESM components. Usually, NestedGrid=1, but it
!                    is possible to merge DATA and an ESM component in a
!                    particular Atmosphere component nested grid.

!
!                    For example, if TimeStep = 15 minutes = 900 seconds and
!                    TimeFrac = 3, the coupling exchange between those two
!                    components is:
!
!                      TimeStep/TimeFrac = 5 minutes = 300 seconds
!
!                    I recommed always to think in terms of seconds.  If
!                    coupling OCN-ATM, you need to consider the time-step
!                    size (DT) of both models and physics to determine the
!                    values of TimeStep and TimeFrac.
!
!                    The ATM model requires smaller DT because of fluid
!                    associated radius of deformation (RD).  The ATM (air) has
!                    a much larger value (RD ~ 1000 km) while OCN (seawater)
!                    has a much smaller value (RD ~ 100 km).  Therefore, the
!                    dynamics of the ATM are faster and require smaller DT.
!                    Contrarily, the dynamics of the OCN is slower and can be
!                    resolved with larger DT.
