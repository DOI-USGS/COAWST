ROMS Dynamic, Automatic, and Static Memory Requirements:
=======================================================

Currently, ROMS uses primarily dynamic and automatic memory which is
allocated at running time. It uses small static memory allocation at
compile time.

The dynamical memory is that associated with the ocean state arrays, and it
is allocated at runtime, and it is persistent until the ROMS termination of
the execution.

The automatic arrays appear in subroutines and functions for temporary
local computations. They are created on entry to the subroutine for
intermediate computations and disappear on exit. The automatic arrays
(meaning non-static) are either allocated on heap or stack memory. If
using the 'ifort' compiler, the option -heap-arrays directs the compiler
to put automatic arrays on the heap instead of the stack. However, it may
affect performance by slowing down the computations. If using stack memory,
the application needs to have enough to avoid weird segmentation faults
during execution. In Linux operating systems, unlimited stack memory is
possible by setting:

 'ulimit -s unlimited'             in your .bashrc
 'limit stacksize unlimited'       in your .cshrc, .tcshrc

The static arrays are allocated at compilation time and the memory reserved
can be neither increased or decreased. Only a few static arrays are used in
ROMS and mainly needed for I/O processing in the mod_netcdf routines.

In serial and shared-memory (OpenMP) applications, the dynamical memory
associated with the ocean state is for full, global variables. Contrarily,
in distributed-memory (MPI) applications, the dynamical memory related
to the ocean state is for the smaller tiled arrays with global indices.
The tiling in only done in the horizontal I- and J-dimensions and not in
the vertical dimension.

Mostly all the ocean state arrays are dereferenced pointers and are
allocated after processing ROMS standard input parameters. Recall that
arrays represent a continuous linear sequence of memory. The pointer
indicates the beginning of the state variable in the memory block.

ROMS now computes an estimate of the dynamical and automatic memory needed
to run an application. The automatic memory is difficult to estimate since
it is volatile. The information below provides the maximum automatic memory
required by few routines:

The automatic arrays used in distributed-memory are accounted separately,
and its maximum buffer size is stored in BmemMax(ng). That is, there is a
value for each nested grid and parallel tile.
