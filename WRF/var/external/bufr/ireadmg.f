C USAGE:    IREADMG (LUNIT, SUBSET, IDATE)
C   INPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     LUNIT    - INTEGER: FORTRAN LOGICAL UNIT NUMBER FOR BUFR FILE
C
C   OUTPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     SUBSET   - CHARACTER*8: TABLE A MNEMONIC FOR TYPE OF BUFR MESSAGE
C                BEING READ
C     IDATE    - INTEGER: DATE-TIME STORED WITHIN SECTION 1 OF BUFR
C                MESSAGE BEING READ, IN FORMAT OF EITHER YYMMDDHH OR
