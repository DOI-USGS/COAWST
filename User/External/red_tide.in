!
! where 1:4 are the number of boundary edges, nLBCvar are the number LBC state

! The lateral boundary conditions for biological tracers are entered with
! a keyword. This keyword is case insensitive and usually has three characters.
! However, it is possible to have compound keywords, if applicable. For example,
! the keyword "RadNud" implies radiation boundary condition with nudging. This
! combination is usually used in active/passive radiation conditions.
!
! It is possible to specify the lateral boundary conditions for all biological
! tracers in a compact form with a single entry.  for example, in a East-West
! periodic application we can just have:
!
!                   W       S       E       N
!                   e       o       a       o

!
!  LBC(isTvar) ==   Per     Clo     Per     Clo
!
! Then, the standard input processing routine will assume that all the
! biological tracers have the same lateral boundary condition specified by
! the single entry.

!
!                   Recall that these switches are usually activated to add
!                   river runoff as a point source. At minimum, it is necessary
!                   to specify both temperature and salinity for all rivers.
!                   The other tracers are optional. The user needs to know the
!                   correspondence between biological variables and indices
!                   idbio(1:NBT) when activating one or more of these switches.
!
!                   These logical switches REPLACES and ELIMINATES the need to
!                   have or read the variable "river_flag(river)" in the input
!                   rivers forcing NetCDF file:
!
!                     double river_flag(river)
!                        river_flag:long_name = "river runoff tracer flag"
!                        river_flag:option_0 = "all tracers are off"
!                        river_flag:option_1 = "only temperature"
!                        river_flag:option_2 = "only salinity"
!                        river_flag:option_3 = "both temperature and salinity"
!                        river_flag:units = "nondimensional"
!
!                   This logic was too cumbersome and complicated when
!                   additional tracers are considered. However, this change
!                   is backward compatible.
!
!                   The LtracerSrc switch will be used to activate the reading
!                   of respective tracer variable from input river forcing
!                   NetCDF file. If you want to add other tracer variables
!                   (other than temperature and salinity) as a source for a
!                   particular river(s), you just need to specify such values
!                   on those river(s). Then, set the values to ZERO on the
!                   other river(s) that do NOT require such river forcing for
!                   that tracer. Recall that you need to specify the tracer
!                   values for all rivers, even if their values are zero.
