# This directory is used to link files from the top-level inc/ directory  #
# that are used for the WRFDA build. They are put in this subdirectory to #
# avoid namespace collisions with WRFDA's .inc files and reduce clutter.  #
#
# This gitignore file is to avoid tracking these compile-time linked      #
# files, as well as to avoid this being an empty directory which can not  #
# be tracked by git.                                                      #
