Running grid nudging
--------------------
Grid nudging is available in Version 2.2.
This nudges the WRF run towards a gridded analysis linearly interpolated in time between
specified analyses. It only requires multiple time periods of analyses for each domain
to be nudged, and these are input to real in the same format as the initial conditions.
To run an fdda job

- run real.exe with grid_fdda = 1
  This will generate an extra input file with the time-varying analyses called wrffdda_d0<n>
- note that each domain can have grid_fdda = 1 or 0 when running nesting
- run wrf.exe with the same grid_fdda setting to use the wrffdda files generated
  Also select wrf run-time options from the list described below to determine which fields to nudge,
    how strongly to nudge, whether to nudge in the boundary layer, or whether to truncate
    nudging below a certain grid level
- There is a ramping capability for dynamic initialization that turns nudging off over a
    specified period
