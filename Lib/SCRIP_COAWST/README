SCRIP_COAWST Wrapper Files Description

1. constants.f*           --> Define common constants
2. iounits.f*             --> I/O unit manager
3. kind_mod.f*            --> defining data types
4. timers.f*              --> CPU timers
4. scripwrap_mod.f        --> declares all the global variables for SCRIP COAWST
5. read_roms.f            --> read ROMS grids - rho, psi and masking values
6. read_swan.f            --> read SWAN grids - rho, psi and masking values
7. read_wrf.f             --> read WRF grids - rho, psi and masking values
8. read_ww3.f             --> read WW3 grids - rho, psi and masking values
9. create_masks.f         --> Assigns masking for each model and calls SCRIP 
                              package routines   
10.grids.f**              --> Takes the grid information from above files.
                              This file was modified from original SCRIP package 
                              to read in data seamlessly from SCRIP_COAWST. 
11. remap_vars.f*         --> common remapping variables
12. remap_dist_wgt.f*     --> routines for dist-weight remap
13. remap_conserv.f**     --> This is modified slightly to allow for 
                              deallocating variables for SCRIP package to 
                              run from within SCRIP_COAWST. Originally contains 
                              routines for conservative remap
14. scrip.f**             --> Original main SCRIP file. Modified for SCRIP 
                              package to make it into a subroutine.
15. remap_write**         --> remap output
16. scrip_coawst.f        --> MAIN program file. Calls for 
                              reading the inputs, grids 
                              and creating masks

NOT USED BUT PART OF ORIGINAL SCRIP PACKAGE
17. remap_bilinear.f*    --> bilinear interp
18. remap_bicubic.f*     --> bicubic  interp
19. remap.f*             --> remapping module
20. scrip_test_repeat.f* --> testing SCRIP
21. scrip_test.f*        --> testing SCRIP

Notes:
    - * refers to Fortran files that were part of original SCRIP Package and have not been altered
    - **refers to Fortran files edited from original SCRIP Package 
    - Currently maximum number of grids allocated to "5" for each ROMS, WRF, SWAN code
    - This can be changed in scripwrap_mod.f to any number 
    - Output netcdf file name is mentioned in input file
