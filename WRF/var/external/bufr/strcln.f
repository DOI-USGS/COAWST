C ABSTRACT: THIS SUBROUTINE RESETS THE MNEMONIC STRING CACHE IN THE
C   BUFR INTERFACE (ARRAYS IN COMMON BLOCK /STCACH/).  THE MNEMONIC
C   STRING CACHE IS A PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DEVICE WHICH SAVES TIME
C   WHEN THE SAME MNEMONIC STRINGS ARE ENCOUNTERED IN A PROGRAM, OVER
C   AND OVER AGAIN (THE TYPICAL SCENARIO).
