# DATA-WRF-ROMS semi-implicit ESMF coupling:                            :::
#                                                                       :::
# This ESMF configuration file includes the Run Sequence to couple      :::
# DATA, WRF, and ROMS components. All the components interact with      :::
# the same coupling time step. The connector from ROMS to WRF is        :::
# explicit, whereas the connector from WRF to ROMS is semi-implicit.    :::
# Usually, the timestep of the atmosphere kernel is smaller than that   :::
# for the ocean. Therefore, WRF export files are time-averaged over     :::
# the coupling interval, which is the same as the ROMS timestep. It     :::
# is semi-implicit because ROMS right-hand-side terms are forced with   :::
# n+1/2 WRF fields because of the time-averaging.                       :::
#                                                                       :::
# The time-averaging is activated with WRF_TIMEAVG in the ROMS build    :::
# script. The WRF "namelist.input" needs to include the parameters      :::
# for the RAMS averaged diagnostics in the &time_control section.       :::
# The User needs to check that the single coupling interval specified   :::
# here is the same as for the ROMS coupling standard input script       :::
# (keyword TimeStep).                                                   :::

# It is not necessary to specify options to the connectors here for     :::
# the "remapMethod" since it is specified in the input coupling         :::
