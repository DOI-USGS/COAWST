Instructions for fast installation of SWAN
------------------------------------------

Full automatic installation of SWAN can be done by means of
the make and perl utilities. Please carry out the following
tasks:

   1) Ensure that the Perl package is available on your computer.
      In most cases, it is available for Linux and a Unix operating
      system. Check it by typing 'perl -v'. Otherwise, you may
      download a free distribution for Linux, Solaris and Windows
      called ActivePerl (www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads).
      The Perl version should be at least 5.0.0 or higher!

   2) Type 'make config' or 'nmake config' (in case of MS Windows)
      to create configuration file. This file (macros.inc) contains
      machine-dependent macros to be needed by the Makefile.

      The following platforms and compilers are supported:

   3) Compilation of the SWAN source code for sequential runs can
      be done by typing 'make ser' or 'nmake ser' (in case of
      MS Windows). For parallel runs, however, the user may
      choose between linking the MPI libraries for distributed
      memory machines and using OpenMP directives for shared memory
      systems for appropriate compilation by typing, respectively,
      'make mpi' and 'make omp'. However, for parallel, unstructured
      mesh simulation on a distributed memory system, type 'make punswan'.
      NOTE: One of these commands must be preceded once by 'make config'.

   4) For more information, please consult the Implementation Manual.
