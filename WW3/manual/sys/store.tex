\subsection{~Internal data storage} \label{sec:common}
\vssub

The remainder of this chapter will deal with the internal data storage used by
\ws. In \para\ref{sec:grids} the layout of a single wave model grid as used in
{\file ww3\_shel} is discussed. In \para\ref{sec:distr} the parallelization
approaches for a single grid are discussed. In \para\ref{sec:mgrids} the
simultaneous storage of multiple wave grids is discussed. Finally, the actual
wave model variables are described in \para\ref{sec:variables}. Note that the
code is fully documented, including the variables defining the data storage.
