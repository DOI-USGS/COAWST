# This ESMF configuration file includes the Run Sequence to couple      :::
# DATA, COAMPS, and ROMS components. All the components interact with   :::
# the same coupling time step. The connector from ROMS to COAMP is      :::
# explicit, whereas the connector from COAMPS to ROMS is semi-implicit. :::
# Usually, the timestep of the atmosphere kernel is smaller than that   :::
# for the ocean. COAMPS export fields are always time-averaged over     :::
# the coupling interval, which is the same as the ROMS timestep. It     :::
# is semi-implicit because ROMS right-hand-side terms are forced with   :::
# n+1/2 COAMPS fields because of the time-averaging.                    :::
#                                                                       :::
