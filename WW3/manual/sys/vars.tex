\subsection{~Variables in modules} \label{sec:variables}

\noindent 
In the documentation of model versions up to version 3.14, all {\F public} and
{\F private} variables in modules were described in the present and following
sections. All these parameters are also documented in the source code of the
model. Keeping two separate unlinked copies of the documentations is becoming
a daunting task with little benefit to the model user and developer. Hence,
from model version \WWver\ on, the main documentation of the variables in the
code is kept up to date in the source code itself, and second full
documentation in the manual is no longer maintained. In this manual, we now
only describe {\F parameter} definitions, as they may influence model
behavior, and identify critical versions of I/O elements of the code.  The
file name of the module is given at the right margin of the start of each
list. The second column of each list identifies the type of the variable. {\F
i}, {\F r}, {\F l} and {\F c} represent integer, real, logical and character,
{\F a} identifies an array, and{ \F p} identifies a {\F parameter}
declaration. All variables are public, unless marked with \opt.  The following
sections account for parameter settings in modules (and programs), and give a
top level description of what is stored in the data structures, and where
these data structures are located in the code.
