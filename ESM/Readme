Earth System Model (ESM) Coupling:
=================================

This directory contains several files used for multi-model coupling
using the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) with the National
Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC) layer.

The NUOPC layer is a simplified infrastructure on top of the ESMF
library (version 7.0 or higher) that provides conventions and
templates to facilitate the smooth coupling between ESM components.
The ROMS coupling interface with the ESMF/NUOPC library allows both
DRIVER and COMPONENT methods of operation.  In the DRIVER method,
it provides all the interfaces needed to couple to other ESM
components including the executable driver, NUOPC-based generic
ESM component services, model gridded components or NUOPC cap files,
connectors between components for re-gridding source and destination
fields, input scripts, and coupling metadata management.  A NUOPC
model 'cap' is a Fortran code layer that sits on top of the ESM
component, making calls to the numerical kernel via the 'initialize',
'run', and 'finalize' phases.  Alternatively, in the COMPONENT method,
the NUOPC ROMS 'cap' module is provided, and it can be adapted and
incorporated into other NUOPC-based coupling systems, like the NOAA
Environmental Modeling System (NEMS).

The strategy is to couple to other ESM components with none or minimal
changes to the code distributed by developers or repositories.  It is
the user responsibility to subscribe to such repositories and download
and install the ESM component.   It expected that the coupling with
such ESM components is not affected its version (previous, current
or future).

However, sometimes we need circumvent technical problems when coupling
to other ESM components and provide build scripts to facilitate
compiling and linking, and correct interference to deprecated libraries.
Therefore, this directory contains scripts and modified ESM component
files that substitute the ones distributed from source repositories
to solve such technical issues.

File Description:
----------------

* coupling_esmf.in:

  Standard input script for ROMS when coupling with the ESMF/NUOPC
library. It is well documented and sets the coupling system. To
submit a job, we could use for example:

  mpirun -np 8 romsM coupling.in > & log &

* coupling_esmf.dat:

  Coupling metadata defining import and export fields.

* build_cice.sh:

  A friendlier CSH script to compile CICE.

* build_wrf.bash, build_wrf.sh:

  BATCH and CSH compiling scripts for WRF to facilitate easy compiling
and linking.  It also corrects several technical issues with very old
ESMF library interference and incorrect NetCDF4 library dependencies.

The files below were adapted from WRF Version 4.0.3 (December 18, 2018)

  - wrf_configure:

       Replaces ${WRF_ROOT_DIR}/configure

       Reworking linking NetCDF4 library dependencies.

  - wrf_add_configure:

       Appends to ${WRF_ROOT_DIR}/configure.wrf

       Adds CPP macros to rename 'ESMF' and 'esmf' to 'MYESMF'
       and 'myesmf' to the dependecies of 'module_domain.o' and
       'output_wrf.o' to avoid conflicts with newer versions of
       the ESMF/NUOPC library.

  - wrf_Makefile:

       Replaces ${WRF_ROOT_DIR}/Makefile

       Reworking linking NetCDF4 library dependencies.

  - wrf_postamble:

       Replaces ${WRF_ROOT_DIR}/arch/postamble

       Reworking linking NetCDF4 library dependencies.

  - wrf_configure.defaults:

       Replaces ${WRF_ROOT_DIR}/arch/configure.defaults

       Substitutes obsolete compiling option -openmp to -qopenmp

       Renames corrences of 'ESMF' and 'esmf' to 'MYESMF' and 'myesmf'
       to avoid conflicts with newer versions of the ESMF. WRF uses
       parts of an old verison of the ESMF library for its internal
       time clock.  This causes conflicts when coupling with newer
       ESMF/NUOPC library.

       Added mixed compiling with Intel/GNU (ifort/gcc) and OpenMPI

   - wrf_Config.pl:

       Replaces ${WRF_ROOT_DIR}/arch/Config.pl

       Renames ocurrences of 'ESMF' and 'esmf' to 'MYESMF' and 'myesmf'
       to avoid conflicts with newer versions of the ESMF.

   - wrf_Makefile.esmf:

       Replaces ${WRF_ROOT_DIR}/external/esmf_time_f90/Makefile

       Renames corrences of 'ESMF' and 'esmf' to 'MYESMF' and 'myesmf'
       to avoid conflicts with newer versions of the ESMF. Everything
       is done during C-preprocessing so original files are not
       modified.

    - wrf_Test1.F90:

       Replaces ${WRF_ROOT_DIR}/external/esmf_time_f90/Test1.F90

       Corrects bug in optional argument to 'ESMF_Initialize' call
       from 'defaultCalendar' to 'defaultCalKind'.
